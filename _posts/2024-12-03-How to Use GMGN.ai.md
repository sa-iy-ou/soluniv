## 4. Analyzing Meme Coins

When evaluating a meme coin, data is your best ally. GMGN.ai provides comprehensive analytics to help you make smart decisions.

### Key Analysis Metrics:
1. **Holder Distribution**:  
   - Look for tokens with decentralized holdings.  
   - Be cautious if a small number of wallets hold the majority of the supply, as it could signal a risk of price manipulation.  

2. **Sniper and Early Buyer Data**:  
   - Identify wallets that bought in early and check their current holdings.  
   - If these wallets hold significant amounts, it may indicate insider activity or potential sell pressure.  

3. **Rug-Pull Probability**:  
   - GMGN.ai uses on-chain data to estimate the likelihood of a token being a scam.  
   - Higher probabilities should raise red flags.

**Tip**: Combine these metrics to form a comprehensive view before investing in any token.
