## Step 2: Create a New Wallet

Now, let‚Äôs set up your Phantom Wallet.

1. Launch Phantom and click **"Create New Wallet"**.  
2. Set a secure password. This password will be required every time you access your wallet.  
   - **Tip**: Use a strong and memorable password, like "Solana123!".

3. Save your **Secret Recovery Phrase**.  
   - This phrase is essential for recovering your wallet if you lose access.  
   - Write it down and store it in a safe place. Never share this phrase with anyone.  
4. Once you‚Äôve safely stored your recovery phrase, complete the setup process.


### Tip: Securely Storing Your Recovery Phrase

For example, storing your recovery phrase or private key directly on the internet can make it vulnerable to hacking. If the data is stolen, your wallet can be compromised.

To securely store sensitive information, I recommend encrypting it and keeping it in a place where others cannot access it.  

Here‚Äôs how I personally handle it:  
- I use a **BASE64 encoding/decoding tool** to encode (encrypt) my recovery phrase.  
- After encoding it, I store the encoded text in a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù location that doesn‚Äôt obviously hint at it being a recovery phrase. For instance, avoid naming the file "Recovery Phrase" or similar. Instead, disguise it among other files or notes.  
- Later, if I need the phrase, I retrieve the text and decode it using the same tool to recover the original phrase.

You can try using this [BASE64 encoding/decoding tool](https://base64encodedecode.netlify.app/).

**Important**: Make sure you don‚Äôt forget where you stored the encoded data! Losing access to this encoded information can make it impossible to recover your wallet. üòÖ

## Step 3: Using Your Phantom Wallet

Congratulations! Your Phantom Wallet is now ready to use.  
Here‚Äôs how you can access it:

- **Desktop**: Click the Phantom icon in your browser toolbar to open your wallet.  
- **Mobile**: Open the Phantom app from your home screen.  

The wallet‚Äôs intuitive interface lets you view your balance, track transactions, and connect to Solana-based dApps (decentralized applications).

## Important Reminders

1. **Never share your recovery phrase.**  
   - Even the Phantom team will never ask for it. Sharing it can lead to the loss of all your funds.

2. **Only download from official sources.**  
   - Beware of fake apps or browser extensions. Always verify that you‚Äôre using [Phantom‚Äôs official website](https://phantom.app/download).  

3. **Enable security features.**  
   - Use a strong password and enable biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) on your device if possible.
